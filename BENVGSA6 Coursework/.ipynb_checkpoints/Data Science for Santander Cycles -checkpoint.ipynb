    "# Introduction\n",
    "First installed in 2010, Santander Cycles bicycles are hired on average 73,000 times per day and have become one of the trademarks of London. This study will analyse the stations that bikes depart from and arrive at, the frequency of overcharged journeys and the routes the bikes more frequently use. This analysis is intended for the improvement of cycle stations and roads, prevention of overcharged journeys and development of cycle navigation systems in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before beginning, four assumptions regarding the data should be mentioned. The first assumption is that all riders select optimised routes (here, the ones suggested by Google Maps). The second assumes that the sampling period is representative; this study only takes into consideration journey data between the 21st of February and the 5th of March 2016. These are the most recent data from Transport for London and the sample consists of 287,745 trips, which is enough to generalise the population.  Also, trips from one station back to the same station will be ignored. In other words, this study will assume these kinds of bikes stay at the same station for the entire time. Lastly, this study assumes bikes are moving at a speed of approximately 16 km/h, regardless of the distance of the trip. This follows the assumption used by Google Maps to predict journey times."

    "To find the distance between start stations and end stations and duration of the trips, Google API is used. The first step is to define a function called ‘distance_matrix’. This begins with a URL which requests a Google Maps distance matrix and sends information of origins, destinations, travelling mode and language. Travelling mode should be bicycling in the process. Lastly, the API key that was previously registered in Google is added. And then, empty columns for distance and duration are created. Lastly, a loop is created to iterate for all the rows of the dataset. In the loop, the latitudes and longitude columns are put into the origins and destinations. And then, the distance_matrix function is executed and it returns a json file name bar. This json file is converted into a DataFrame named matrixdf through json_normalize. Subsequently, only the values in the distance column and duration column in matrixdf are added to the original DataFrame, journeydf. "

    "The Transport for London policy for Santander cycles is to charge £2 to access the bikes for 24 hours, and the first 30 minutes of each journey are free.(Transport for London, 2010) Longer journeys cost £2 for each extra period up to 30 minutes. (Transport for London, 2010) Thus, all journeys longer than 30 minutes are overcharged. This study will use a classification algorithm to predict whether a journey is overcharged or not, based solely on distance and duration that previously estimated by Google Maps and average duration extracted from the journey data.\n",

    "Up to this point, the locations and uses of Santander Cycle stations have been analysed, a classification algorithm to predict overcharged journeys has been created and the roads mostly used by users have been ascertained. This study can be used in a variety of ways. One suggestion is in development of bike navigation systems. For example, the classification algorithms can enable the navigation to send an alert message to the cyclists saying “This journey is expected to be overcharged” in advance. "
